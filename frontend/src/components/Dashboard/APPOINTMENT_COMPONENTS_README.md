## Styling

All components use:

## Sample Data

The components currently use sample data. To connect to a backend:

1. Replace the `useState` initial data with API calls
2. Use `useEffect` to fetch data on component mount
3. Update the save/delete functions to make API requests

Example:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/appointments')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setAppointments(data));
}, []);
```
